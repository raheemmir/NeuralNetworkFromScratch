# A Neural Network From Scratch

This machine learning project focuses on developing a simple feed forward neural network from scratch, 
without using an implementation found in popular libraries/frameworks like TensorFlow or Pytorch. Instead, the network's implementation primarily uses NumPy. 
The objective of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamentals behind neural networks, such as backward propagation, 
training the network, and the role of weights and biases. Speaking of backpropagation, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znqbtL0fRA0) was particularly helpful during the research/development process.  

The network was trained and tested on 28 x 28 images of hand written digits from the MNIST dataset (sourced from Keras), achieving high levels
of accuracy.
